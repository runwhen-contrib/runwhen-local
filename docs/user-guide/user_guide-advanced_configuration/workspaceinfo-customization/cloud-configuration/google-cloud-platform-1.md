# Google Cloud Platform

{% hint style="info" %}
Google Cloud Platform discovery is supported from 0.5.0 onwards supports discovery of resources **outside of Kubernetes,** such as VMs, load balancers, database instances, and so on. Kubernetes resources discovery configuration is covered in [getting-started.md](../../../getting-started.md "mention")
{% endhint %}

### GCP Credentials

Google Cloud Platform discovery leverages [cloudquery](https://github.com/cloudquery/cloudquery) with the GCP source plugin to build up an inventory of cloud resources that should be matched with troubleshooting commands. &#x20;

It's recommended to create a [service account ](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts-create)for use with RunWhen Local and the CloudQuery discovery component:&#x20;

```
export PROJECT_ID=[project-id]
export KEY_FILE=GCPServiceAccountKeyWorkspaceBuilder.json
export SA_NAME=runwhen-local-sa
gcloud iam service-accounts create $SA_NAME \
    --description="Service Account for RunWhen Discovery" \
    --display-name="RunWhen Discovery Service Account"
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT_ID \
    --member="serviceAccount:$SA_NAME@$PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
    --role="roles/viewer"
gcloud iam service-accounts keys create $KEY_FILE \
    --iam-account=$SA_NAME@$PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

The output will be a service account file called `GCPServiceAccountKeyWorkspaceBuilder.json` which needs to be copied to the `shared` directory that is accessible to the RunWhen Local container image.&#x20;

### GCP CloudQuery Version Details

* Currently supported source plugin: [GCP v9.9.2](https://hub.cloudquery.io/plugins/source/cloudquery/gcp/v9.9.2/docs#configuration)
* Available resources: See [this link](https://hub.cloudquery.io/plugins/source/cloudquery/gcp/v9.9.2/tables)

### GCP WorkspaceInfo Configuration

To perform discovery of Google Cloud resources, provide the path to the GCP service account credentials inside of the workspaceInfo.yaml under the `cloudConfig` section. For example:&#x20;

```
cloudConfig:
  gcp:
    applicationCredentialsFile: /shared/GCPServiceAccountKeyWorkspaceBuilder.json
    projects:
    - [project-id]
    projectLevelOfDetails:
      [project-id]: basic
```

The supported fields for GCP (block name = "gcp") are:

| Field Name                 | Description                                                               |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| applicationCredentialsFile | Name of the credentials file to use to authenticate                       |
| projects                   | List of names of the projects to index                                    |
| projectLevelOfDetails      | Object/dictionary specifying level of detail values for specific projects |

The "applicationCredentialsFile" is the name of the file in the shared directory to use to authenticate to GCP. This file is created/downloaded using the GCP CLI or web GUI. Similar to Azure, the GCP support is based on CloudQuery, so the documentation page for the CloudQuery GCP plugin (https://hub.cloudquery.io/plugins/source/cloudquery/gcp/v11.5.1/docs) contains more details about the credentials file.

The "projects" fields specifies the list of projects to index. In that case the application credentials file must be configured so that it can access multiple projects. Consult the GCP documentation for how to do that. The entries in this list are project ID values.

The "projectLevelOfDetails" is similar to the Kubernetes namespaceLODs field except that the key/field name is the name of the project (more specifically, the project ID).
