# Upload to RunWhen Platform

RunWhen Local generates workspace configuration files (see [workspace-builder.md](workspace-builder.md "mention")) that can be uploaded to the RunWhen Platform, automatically constructing a fully configured map of your resources and associated troubleshooting tasks.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
If uploading your configuration for the first time, and using the Runner, please see [runner-agent.md](runner-agent.md "mention") before performing this step.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### Uploading to the RunWhen Platform

#### Upload from the UI

RunWhen Local hosts a page titled **RunWhen Platform Upload** - it is accessible from the left hand navigation, or by selecting the **Upload to RunWhen Platform** icon in the header. This page should outline all necessary steps required to:&#x20;

* Create a new RunWhen Platform Workspace
* Prepare for Upload (by fetchting and attaching the `uploadInfo.yaml`)
* Upload all configuration
* Create secrets (for communication with your cluster(s))

#### Upload from the CLI

RunWhen Local will look for the file called `uploadInfo.yaml` in the `/shared` directory of the container image. This file is obtained from the RunWhen Platform interface from **Configuration --> Workspace --> Automated Workspace Builder Config File**

With this file in place, re-run the discovery process with the `--upload` flag:&#x20;

```
docker exec -w /workspace-builder -e WB_DEBUG_SUPPRESS_CHEAT_SHEET="true" -- RunWhenLocal  ./run.sh --upload
```

{% hint style="info" %}
To speed up this step, we also skip the cheat sheet rendering in this step by passing `-e WB_DEBUG_SUPPRESS_CHEAT_SHEET="true"` in the docker exec command
{% endhint %}

#### Additional Upload Options for Merge Conflicts

Additional upload options are available to handle certain cases where the same SLX already exists on the platform and RunWhen Local has generated new configuration under the same name:&#x20;

```
--upload-merge-mode keep-uploaded
    - Favor the current configuration and overwrite what is in RunWhen Platform
--upload-merge-mode keep-existing 
    (default) - Preserve any configuration already in place in RunWhen Platform
```
