  These steps get you started with downloading the RunWhen Local container image
  and preparing it to produce a troubleshooting cheat sheet that is tailored for
  your environment.

# Running Locally

{% hint style="info" %}
The following steps allow you to safely run RunWhen from your own laptop, with the ability to inspect all generated configuration files and command list documentation without the need to interact with the RunWhen API.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
If you have any issues with this process, have a look at [stuck-read-this.md](../stuck-read-this.md "mention") or feel free to reach out on [Slack](https://runwhen.slack.com/join/shared\_invite/zt-1l7t3tdzl-IzB8gXDsWtHkT8C5nufm2A),  [GitHub](https://github.com/runwhen-contrib/runwhen-local) or [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/Ut7Ws4rm8Q)
{% endhint %}

### Pull the RunWhen Local Container Image

The RunWhen Local container image might take a little time to download. Start by pulling the image while you move on to the next steps in a separate terminal.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Docker/x86" %}
```
docker pull ghcr.io/runwhen-contrib/runwhen-local:latest
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Docker/arm64" %}
```
docker pull --platform=linux/arm64 ghcr.io/runwhen-contrib/runwhen-local:latest
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Podman macOS/x86" %}
```
# Pull the image
podman pull ghcr.io/runwhen-contrib/runwhen-local:latest
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Podman macOS/arm64" %}
<pre><code># Pull the image
<strong>podman pull --platform=linux/arm64 ghcr.io/runwhen-contrib/runwhen-local:latestpodman pull --platform=linux/arm64 ghcr.io/runwhen-contrib/runwhen-local:latest
</strong></code></pre>
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}



### Prepare a Working Directory

* Create the working directory: _**changing this path as desired**_

```
# Set your preferred runwhen-local working directory 
export workdir=~/runwhen-local
```

The working directory is used to share files with the map builder container, while also provide a path for the container write its output.

* Create a **workspaceInfo.yaml** file, and an **output directory**
* The **output directory** is set with **open permissions** so that the container can write the output to it - there is no sensitive data (such as secrets/kubeconfigs/etc) in the _output folder_

{% hint style="info" %}
The **output directory** is shared so that you can easily review the generated configuration files without needing to exec into the container.&#x20;

If using Podman with macOS, make sure`$workdir/output` resides in `/Users`.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
All keys with the value **placeholder** are required, but the value can be left as `placeholder` (they are only used when uploading content to the RunWhen platform for AI assisted troubleshooting)
{% endhint %}

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Kubernetes/GKE" %}
```
mkdir -p $workdir/shared/output

# Set the output directory to 777 so that the runwhen container user can write 
# out the configuraiton files: 
chmod 777 $workdir/shared/output

cat <<EOF > $workdir/shared/workspaceInfo.yaml
workspaceName: my-workspace
# All content with [placeholder] is only updated
# and auto-generated when using the RunWhen Platform
# leave it as [placeholder] if only using RunWhen Local

chmod 655 $workdir/shared/workspaceInfo.yaml
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="OpenShift" %}
```
mkdir -p ~/runwhen-local/shared/output

# The ouput directory needs to be written to from the container image: 
chmod 777 ~/runwhen-local/shared/output

cat <<EOF > ~/runwhen-local/shared/workspaceInfo.yaml
workspaceName: my-workspace
# Tokens are generated from the RunWhen Platform UI if 
# planning on uploading workspace configuration

  kubeconfig_secret_name: kubeconfig
  gcp_ops_suite_sa: ops-suite-sa
EOF
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Everything in the workspaceInfo.yaml file that has a \[placeholder] beside it is not required for RunWhen Local to function . They are required when uploading configurations to the RunWhen Platform and are generated automatically when needed.
{% endhint %}

### Generating your Kubeconfig

RunWhen Local needs a [kubeconfig](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/) that provides access to your cluster to discover resources.

The good thing is, if you've regularly used a Kubernetes cluster, you most likely have a kubeconfig. We just need to get it ready for RunWhen Local. The following script will help create a new version, or you can craft your own.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Simple: Generate From Existing Kubeconfig" %}
{% hint style="info" %}
These step uses [**yq**](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq)  and [**jq**](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) to create a new kubeconfig for RunWhen Local to use. See the [yq install documentation](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq#install) to obtain the tool. It currently supports creating a kubeconfig with a short lived token for GKE and OKE clusters.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
This script _will not modify your existing kubeconfig._ It will copy the contents (defaulted from \~/.kube/config) into a file that is usable by RunWhen Local. It is still on your local machine and safe to use.
{% endhint %}

* Fetch the _gen\_rw\_kubeconfig.sh_ from [GitHub](https://github.com/runwhen-contrib/runwhen-local/blob/main/deploy/scripts/gen\_rw\_kubeconfig.sh)

<pre><code><strong>
</strong><strong>curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/runwhen-contrib/runwhen-local/main/deploy/scripts/gen_rw_kubeconfig.sh > gen_rw_kubeconfig.sh
</strong>
</code></pre>

* Run the script to generate the kubeconfig

```
# Set executable permissions on the script
chmod +x gen_rw_kubeconfig.sh

# Run the script
./gen_rw_kubeconfig.sh
```

{% hint style="info" %}
If temporary tokens are generated through this process (such as with GKE or OKE), rerun the script as needed once the tokens expire
{% endhint %}
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Advanced: Service Account kubeconfig" %}
If you already have a service account in your cluster, or wish to use a service account with a standard kubeconfig, see [generating-service-accounts-and-kubeconfigs.md](../../runwhen-platform/guides/kubernetes-environments/generating-service-accounts-and-kubeconfigs.md "mention") - and come back here when you're done!

Based on how you created the kubeconfig in the above step, you will want to copy it to `~/runwhen-local/shared/kubeconfig`

```
cp ${newFile} ~/$workdir/shared/kubeconfig
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

###

### Generating your Cheat Sheet

With the working directory in place, there are two more steps to generate the your troubleshooting cheat sheet:

* Run the container image

{% hint style="info" %}
Run this command within the same terminal that was used to prepare $workdir.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Docker" %}
```
docker run --name RunWhenLocal -p 8081:8081 -v $workdir/shared:/shared -d ghcr.io/runwhen-contrib/runwhen-local:latest
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Podman Machine (macOS x86)" %}
```
# Run the container image
podman run --name RunWhenLocal -p 8081:8081 -v $workdir/shared:/shared  --userns=keep-id:uid=999,gid=999 ghcr.io/runwhen-contrib/runwhen-local:latest
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Podman Machine (macOS amd64)" %}
```
# Run the container image
podman run --platform=linux/arm64 --name RunWhenLocal -p 8081:8081 -v $workdir/shared:/shared  --userns=keep-id:uid=999,gid=999 ghcr.io/runwhen-contrib/runwhen-local:latest
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

* Execute the script to perform discovery and build documentation:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Docker" %}
```
docker exec -w /workspace-builder -- RunWhenLocal ./run.sh
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Podman Machine (macOS x86)" %}
```
podman exec -w /workspace-builder -- RunWhenLocal ./run.sh
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Depending on the amount of resources to in your cluster(s), the discovery process may take a few minutes to complete.
{% endhint %}

### Viewing the Troubleshooting Cheat Sheet

When the process has completed, you can navigate to [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081) to view the troubleshooting commands generated for your environment.

### Cleanup

* Cleaning up the running container and image

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Docker" %}
<pre><code><strong>docker kill RunWhenLocal; docker rm RunWhenLocal
</strong></code></pre>
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Podman" %}
```
podman kill RunWhenLocal; podman rm RunWhenLocal
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
