  These steps get you started with downloading the RunWhen Local container image
  and preparing it to produce a troubleshooting cheat sheet that is tailored for
  your environment.

# Running Locally with Docker

{% hint style="info" %}
The following steps allow you to safely run RunWhen from your own laptop (with docker/podman), with the ability to inspect all generated configuration files and command list documentation without the need to interact with the RunWhen API.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
If you have any issues with this process, have a look at [**Generating Service Accounts and Kubeconfigs**](https://docs.runwhen.com/public/runwhen-platform/guides/kubernetes-environments/generating-service-accounts-and-kubeconfigs), or feel free to reach out on [Slack](https://runwhen.slack.com/join/shared\_invite/zt-1l7t3tdzl-IzB8gXDsWtHkT8C5nufm2A), [GitHub](https://github.com/runwhen-contrib/runwhen-local) or [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/Ut7Ws4rm8Q)
{% endhint %}

### Pull the RunWhen Local Container Image

The RunWhen Local container image might take a little time to download. Start by pulling the image while you move on to the next steps in a separate terminal.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Docker/x86" %}
```
docker pull ghcr.io/runwhen-contrib/runwhen-local:latest
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Docker/arm64" %}
```
docker pull --platform=linux/arm64 ghcr.io/runwhen-contrib/runwhen-local:latest
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Podman macOS/x86" %}
```
# Pull the image
podman pull ghcr.io/runwhen-contrib/runwhen-local:latest
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Podman macOS/arm64" %}
<pre><code># Pull the image
<strong>podman pull --platform=linux/arm64 ghcr.io/runwhen-contrib/runwhen-local:latestpodman pull --platform=linux/arm64 ghcr.io/runwhen-contrib/runwhen-local:latest
</strong></code></pre>
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Prepare a Working Directory

* Create the working directory: _**changing this path as desired**_

```
# Set your preferred runwhen-local working directory 
export workdir=~/runwhen-local
```

The working directory is used to share files with the map builder container, while also provide a path for the container write its output.

* Create a **workspaceInfo.yaml** file, and an **output directory**
* The **output directory** is set with **open permissions** so that the container can write the output to it - there is no sensitive data (such as secrets/kubeconfigs/etc) in the _output folder_

{% hint style="info" %}
The **output directory** is shared so that you can easily review the generated configuration files without needing to exec into the container.

If using Podman with macOS, make sure`$workdir/output` resides in `/Users`.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
All keys with the value **placeholder** are required, but the value can be left as `placeholder` (they are only used when uploading content to the RunWhen platform for AI assisted troubleshooting)
{% endhint %}

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Kubernetes/GKE" %}
```
mkdir -p $workdir/shared/output

# Set the output directory to 777 so that the runwhen container user can write 
# out the configuration files: 
chmod -R 777 $workdir/shared

cat <<EOF > $workdir/shared/workspaceInfo.yaml
workspaceName: my-workspace
# All content with [placeholder] is only updated
# and auto-generated when using the RunWhen Platform
# leave it as [placeholder] if only using RunWhen Local
# See https://docs.runwhen.com/public/v/runwhen-local/user-guide/user_guide-advanced_configuration
workspaceOwnerEmail: tester@my-company.com

  # If using GCP and wanting to use GCP integrations  
  gcp_project_id: placeholder 
  
  # Secret names are used when integrating the RunWhen Platform
  # with your enviornment. RunWhen has no access to this data, 
  # as the secret name and content comes from your own configuration. 
  kubeconfig_secret_name: kubeconfig
  gcp_ops_suite_sa: ops-suite-sa
EOF
chmod 655 $workdir/shared/workspaceInfo.yaml
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="OpenShift" %}
```
mkdir -p $workdir/shared/output

# The ouput directory needs to be written to from the container image: 
chmod 777 $workdir/shared/output

cat <<EOF > $workdir/shared/workspaceInfo.yaml
workspaceName: my-workspace
# Tokens are generated from the RunWhen Platform UI if 
# planning on uploading workspace configuration
workspaceOwnerEmail: tester@my-company.com
defaultLocation: [placeholder]
defaultLOD: 2
namespaceLODs:
  kube-system: 0
  kube-public: 0
  kube-node-lease: 0

  # Possible values are gcp, aws

  # gcp_project_id: [gcp-project-id] 
  
  # Secret names are used when integrating the RunWhen Platform
  # with your enviornment. RunWhen has no access to this data, 
  # as the secret name and content comes from your own configuration. 
  kubeconfig_secret_name: kubeconfig
  # gcp_ops_suite_sa: ops-suite-sa
EOF
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Everything in the workspaceInfo.yaml file that has a \[placeholder] beside it is not required for RunWhen Local to function . They are required when uploading configurations to the RunWhen Platform and are generated automatically when needed.
{% endhint %}

### Generating your Kubeconfig

RunWhen Local needs a [kubeconfig](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/) that provides access to your cluster to discover resources.

The good thing is, if you've regularly used a Kubernetes cluster, you most likely have a kubeconfig. We just need to get it ready for RunWhen Local. The following script will help create a new version, or you can craft your own.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Simple: Generate From Existing Kubeconfig" %}
{% hint style="info" %}
These step uses [**yq**](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq) and [**jq**](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) to create a new kubeconfig for RunWhen Local to use. See the [yq install documentation](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq#install) to obtain the tool. It currently supports creating a kubeconfig with a short lived token for GKE and OKE clusters.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
This script _will not modify your existing kubeconfig._ It will copy the contents (defaulted from \~/.kube/config, but also supports KUBECONFIG) into a file that is usable by RunWhen Local. It is still on your local machine and safe to use.
{% endhint %}

* Fetch the _gen\_rw\_kubeconfig.sh_ from [GitHub](../deploy/scripts/gen\_rw\_kubeconfig.sh)

<pre><code>
<strong>curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/runwhen-contrib/runwhen-local/main/deploy/scripts/gen_rw_kubeconfig.sh > gen_rw_kubeconfig.sh
</strong>
</code></pre>

* Run the script to generate the kubeconfig

```
# Set executable permissions on the script
chmod +x gen_rw_kubeconfig.sh

# Run the script
./gen_rw_kubeconfig.sh
```

{% hint style="info" %}
If temporary tokens are generated through this process (such as with GKE, OKE, or azure cli), rerun the script as needed once the tokens expire
{% endhint %}
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Advanced: Service Account kubeconfig" %}
If you already have a service account in your cluster, or wish to use a service account with a standard kubeconfig, see [Generating Service Accounts and Kubeconfigs](https://docs.runwhen.com/public/runwhen-platform/guides/kubernetes-environments/generating-service-accounts-and-kubeconfigs) and come back here when you're done!

Based on how you created the kubeconfig in the above step, you will want to copy it to `$workdir/shared/kubeconfig`

```
cp ${newFile} $workdir/shared/kubeconfig
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

###

### Generating your Cheat Sheet

With the working directory in place, there are two more steps to generate the your troubleshooting cheat sheet:

* Run the container image

{% hint style="info" %}
Run this command within the same terminal that was used to prepare $workdir.
{% endhint %}

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Docker" %}
```
docker run --name RunWhenLocal -p 8081:8081 -v $workdir/shared:/shared -d ghcr.io/runwhen-contrib/runwhen-local:latest
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Podman Machine (macOS x86)" %}
```
# Run the container image
podman run --name RunWhenLocal -p 8081:8081 -v $workdir/shared:/shared  --userns=keep-id:uid=999,gid=999 ghcr.io/runwhen-contrib/runwhen-local:latest
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Podman Machine (macOS amd64)" %}
```
# Run the container image
podman run --platform=linux/arm64 --name RunWhenLocal -p 8081:8081 -v $workdir/shared:/shared  --userns=keep-id:uid=999,gid=999 ghcr.io/runwhen-contrib/runwhen-local:latest
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

* Execute the script to perform discovery and build documentation:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Docker" %}
```
docker exec -w /workspace-builder -- RunWhenLocal ./run.sh
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Podman Machine (macOS x86)" %}
```
podman exec -w /workspace-builder -- RunWhenLocal ./run.sh
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Depending on the amount of resources to in your cluster(s), the discovery process may take a few minutes to complete.
{% endhint %}

### Viewing the Troubleshooting Cheat Sheet

When the process has completed, you can navigate to [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081) to view the troubleshooting commands generated for your environment.

### Optional: Add a CLI Shortcut

If you would like a shortcut from the CLI to open your cheatsheet, the following may help:&#x20;

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Linux/MacOS" %}
* **Open Terminal**: This can usually be found in your applications or by searching.
* **Edit the Bash Profile**:
  * For **Linux**, you'll typically edit the `.bashrc` file. For **macOS**, you'll edit the `.bash_profile` or `.zshrc` if you're using zsh.
  * Use a text editor like nano or vim. For example, type `nano ~/.bashrc` (Linux) or `nano ~/.bash_profile` (macOS) and press Enter.
* **Add the Alias**:
  *   At the end of the file, add the following line:

      ```bash
      alias runwhen-local='open http://127.0.0.1:8081 &>/dev/null &'
      ```
  * For macOS, `open` is the command to open the URL in your default browser. For Linux, you might need to use `xdg-open` instead of `open`.
* **Save and Exit**:
  * For nano, press `CTRL + X`, then `Y` to confirm, and `Enter` to exit.
  * For vim, press `Esc`, type `:wq`, and press `Enter`.
* **Activate the Alias**:
  * To make the alias available, you need to reload the profile. Type `source ~/.bashrc` (Linux) or `source ~/.bash_profile` (macOS) and press Enter.
* **Test the Alias**:
  * Simply type `runwhen-local` in your terminal and press Enter. It should open your default browser to the specified website.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Microsoft PowerShell" %}
* **Check if a Profile Already Exists**:
  * In PowerShell, type `Test-Path $PROFILE` and press Enter. If it returns `True`, then you already have a profile.
* **Create or Edit the Profile**:
  * If you don't have a profile, create one by typing `New-Item -path $PROFILE -type file -force`.
  * Open the profile in a text editor, such as Notepad, by typing `notepad $PROFILE`.
* **Add the Function and Alias to Your Profile**:
  *   Add the following lines to the profile script:

      ```powershell
      function Open-RunWhenLocal { Start-Process "http://127.0.0.1:8081" }
      Set-Alias -Name runwhen-local Open-RunWhenLocal
      ```
  * Save and close the file.
* **Reload Your Profile** (or restart PowerShell):
  * Type `. $PROFILE` to reload your profile in the current session.
* **Test the Alias Again**:
  * Type `runwhen-local` and press Enter. It should open your default browser to the specified website.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Cleanup

* Cleaning up the running container and image

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Docker" %}
<pre><code><strong>docker kill RunWhenLocal; docker rm RunWhenLocal
</strong></code></pre>
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Podman" %}
```
podman kill RunWhenLocal; podman rm RunWhenLocal
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}



### Next Steps

If you're using RunWhen Local as way of building your [**RunWhen Platform**](https://docs.runwhen.com/public/runwhen-platform/getting-started-with-runwhen-platform) workspace, jump to [upload-to-runwhen-platform.md](user-guide/features/upload-to-runwhen-platform.md "mention")to complete this process.&#x20;
