# Advanced Configuration

The RunWhen Local tool has a number of advanced options in the discovery phase to help customize the resources it can discover, how to group the resources, and how to customize the configurations generated for the RunWhen Platform. These customizations currently include:&#x20;

* Generation rules source locations:&#x20;
  * Generation rules help match discovered resources with open source troubleshooting code, and can be extended or customized as needed
* Kubeconfig file source location:
  * Useful if the default kubeconfig file location or name doesn't work
* Group rules source locations:&#x20;
  * Useful for customizing how resources are grouped
  * Affects the RunWhen Platform groups on the Map
  * Affects the navigation bar in RunWhen Local
* Persona customizations (applicable to the RunWhen Platform only)



The complete documentation for advanced configuration and usage is still under development. Please reach out to us via [Slack](https://runwhen.slack.com/join/shared\_invite/zt-1l7t3tdzl-IzB8gXDsWtHkT8C5nufm2A) if you are interested in applying customisation to the tool. &#x20;
