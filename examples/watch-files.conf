# RunWhen Local File Watcher Configuration
# 
# This file defines which files in /shared/ should be watched for changes
# to trigger automatic workspace discovery runs.
#
# Usage:
#   1. Copy this file to /shared/watch-files.conf in your working directory
#   2. Edit the list below to include only the files you want to watch
#   3. Lines starting with # are ignored (comments)
#   4. Empty lines are ignored
#
# Default files (recommended):
/shared/workspaceInfo.yaml
/shared/uploadInfo.yaml

# Example: Add ConfigMaps or Secrets that should trigger reloads
# /shared/my-configmap.yaml
# /shared/my-secret.yaml

# Note: Files created by the script itself (like kubeconfig, in_cluster_kubeconfig.yaml, 
# db.sqlite3) should NOT be included to prevent race conditions.
