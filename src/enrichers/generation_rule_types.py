        FIXME: I'm not sure this is really needed anymore. In the early version of the WB the
        idea was that all of the template variables used in the templates for a gen rule
        needed to be specified explicitly in the gen rule. But that turned out to be
        annoying for the gen rule developer, since there were a few common ones that were
        almost always added. So instead, now all of the common ones are just implicitly
        added via the add_resource_template_variables method (above). I guess in theory
        it's possible that there might be a platform handler that has a bunch of supported
        special template variable values and we don't want to add all of them for every
        gen rule, so this could be used to specify less common template variables, which
        would need to be specified explicitly in the gen rule. I'm guessing that's not
        use case we'll have in practice, though. But for now I'm not sure if there are
        any of our gen rules that are taking advantage of this mechanism and I don't want
        to break them, so I'll continue to support it for now. Should check with Shea
        and/or do an audit pass over our gen rules to see if anything is still using this.
        If not, I'll probably remove it just to simplify things.
