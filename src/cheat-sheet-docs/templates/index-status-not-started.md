# Community Powered Troubleshooting Cheat sheet

Welcome to your troubleshooting cheat sheet:

  ➡️ a local tool, run by you, on your system  
  ➡️ that discovers your resources,  
  ➡️ finds useful troubleshooting commands from a community of engineers, and  
  ➡️ combines them into a (locally stored) copy & paste-able cheat sheet
