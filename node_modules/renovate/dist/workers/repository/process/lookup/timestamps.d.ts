/**
 * Calculates the `bumpedAt` value for a set of releases.
 *
 * This function determines the highest release (a release with the highest version)
 * and checks if its timestamp is also the highest among all releases.
 * If so, it assigns that timestamp as the `bumpedAt` value in the result.
 * This helps identify if the package was abandoned.
 *
 * The function skips setting `bumpedAt` if:
 * - No releases could be determined as the highest (e.g. for invalid versions)
 * - The highest release is deprecated
 * - A lower version has a more recent timestamp than the highest version
 *
 * @returns The `ReleaseResult` value, potentially updated with a `bumpedAt` timestamp
