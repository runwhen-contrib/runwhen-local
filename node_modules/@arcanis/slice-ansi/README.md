[![](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@arcanis/slice-ansi.svg)]() [![](https://img.shields.io/npm/l/@arcanis/slice-ansi.svg)]() [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/developed%20with-Yarn%202-blue)](https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry)

## Installation

```
yarn add @arcanis/slice-ansi
```

## Why

Unlike the [Chalk version](https://github.com/chalk/slice-ansi), this completely different implementation:

- Supports terminal hyperlinks
- Leverages the native grapheme splitting API if available
- Doesn't require ESM, because it's an inane requirement for a library like this
